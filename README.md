# 21Days_of_Code

## Overview

This repository documents my journey through the 21DaysOfCoding Challenge. I took this challenge on the 21st of December. During this challenge, I committed to solving at least one coding problem each day for 21 days on Platforms like Geeks for Geeks and LeetCode, fostering a consistent coding routine.

## Structure:

* Each day's solutions are organized in a separate folder, each file named after the problem.
* The code is written in Java.
* Clear and concise comments accompany the code for better understanding.

## Why 21DaysOfCoding?

Participating in the 21DaysOfCoding Challenge allowed me to maintain small yet effective coding streaks, establishing a consistent routine. This practice not only enhanced my problem-solving skills but also prepared me for technical interviews during placement initiatives. During these 21 days, I mainly focused on Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues as well as Greedy Algorithms.
